[Sliding Window](https://github.com/AlexOei/CodingInterviews/blob/main/README.md#sliding-window)


## Sliding Window
### General Psuedocode:
Prerequisite variables: left pointer, best result  
Prerequisite Data Structures: Usually a hashmap, array, or dequeue  
Process an input (if necessary): Usually hashmap or array of one of the inputs  
- Iterate through the array  
  - Add to the window if constraint is fulfilled  
  - Check if the current answer is better  
  - Move the left end of the window/pointer if constraint is fulfilled
- Return the desired value
