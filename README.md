## Sliding Window

### Clarifying Questions:
- Time and Space Constraints
- Inputs
  - empty?
  - valid?
  - negative?
- Solutions
  - no solution?
  - multiple solutions?

### General Psuedocode:  
```
class Solution:
    def something(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
    
        Prereq Variables: left and/or right pointer, current result, best result
        Prereq Structures: usually hashmap, array, or dequeue
        Process Inputs if needed

        Base Cases: If null or constraint is not fulfilled
        
        Iterate through Array
            Add to window if constraint is fulfilled
            Check if answer is better if constraint is fulfilled
            Move left pointer if constraint is fulfilled
        Return answer
        
```
